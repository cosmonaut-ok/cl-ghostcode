Vary tiny library for adding functions, macros and variables as data objects (ghost objects) with possibility to expand it to real
functions, macros or variables. Ex. ghostfunction can be expanded to ordinary function, lambda function, macro, or/and
flet/labels/macrolet region at many different places or your program.

ghostcode could make your code much mode dinamic than before!
 

List of functions and macros:

* defvar-ghost
* expand-ghost-to-var
* expand-ghost-to-parameter
* expand-ghosts-to-vars
* expand-ghosts-to-parameters
* expand-ghosts-to-let
* expand-ghosts-to-let*
* defun-ghost
* expand-ghost-to-func
* expand-ghost-to-macro
* expand-ghost-to-lambda
* expand-ghosts-to-funcs
* expand-ghosts-to-macros
* expand-ghosts-to-flet
* expand-ghosts-to-labels
* expand-ghosts-to-macros
